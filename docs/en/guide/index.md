# Introduction

## Dolphin Admin

Dolphin Admin is a **full-stack admin system** based on `TypeScript`.

## Why not JavaScript?

- `TypeScript` has static type checking, which can capture errors at the coding stage.
- `TypeScript` compiler has better support (including code completion, type checking, refactoring, etc.).
- `TypeScript` is more maintainable than `JavaScript`.
- `TypeScript` has better support for object-oriented programming.
